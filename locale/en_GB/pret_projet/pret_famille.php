	<h2>Family Credit & Age brackets of the children</h2>
	<p>
		The amount of the family credit is among other conditions determined by the number and the age bracket of the child.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>< 6 years</li>
		<li>6 to 10 years</li>
		<li>10 to 12 years</li>
		<li>+ 12 years</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The older the child is, the more the costs are higher. When the costs increase, the amount of credit that you would be entitled tends to decrease.
	</p>
