		You wish to get a <a href='/fr/{l file='urls' term='credit-prive-en-ligne.html'}'>personal loan</a> but you don’t know if your financial situation allows it ?<br/>
		You find below the terms of incomes and solvency to be fulfilled so that your credit application is accepted. 
	</p>
	<h2>Conditions for granting a credit based on your financial situation</h2>
	<h3>Minimum monthly income – professional activity    </h3>
	<p>
		To subscribe to a private credit, you must submit a current employment contract and justify a minimum monthly income of 2'600 CHF net before tax. 
		Below this threshold, your credit application can’t succeed. 
	</p>
	<h3>Solvency</h3>
	<p>
		You have some current debt and you wonder if you can subscribe to a private loan? It depends on your situation: 
	</p>
	<h4>If you have pursuits :</h4>
	<p>
		So that your credit application is considered, you have to fulfill the two further conditions : 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Having a spouse who is solvent</li>
		<li>The amount of your debt must be lower than 20'000</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>If you are victim of an act of defects in property</h4>
	<p>
		In this case, it is impossible to get a private loan. 
	</p>
	<h3>Additional conditions for accepting the application</h3>
	<p>
		You meet the required financial conditions for the granting of a private credit?<br/> 
		Now you just have to make sure you also meet our other conditions :
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Your <a href='/fr/{l file='urls' term='profil/limite-age.html'}'>age</a></li>
