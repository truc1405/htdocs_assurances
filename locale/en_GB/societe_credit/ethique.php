	<p>
		CC Credit Conseils SA offers you its services by applying a certain ethic throughout the process of your <a href='/fr/{l file='urls' term='credit-prive-en-ligne.html'}'>credit application</a>, from the online application form, to the signing of the contract going through the research of the adequate offer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Everyone in your team respect the 3 golden rules of our ethical code :
	</p>
	<h2>Rule Nr 1: No over indebtedness</h2>
	<p>
		Our consultants are not looking to finalize a maximum of files. The impact on your finances of the requested credit is really important to us.
	</p>	
	<p>
		Thus, we categorically refuse to manage files on cases of people being subjected to acts of defects in property. It is the same for the persons having pursuits, except in some very clear cases. 
	</p>
	<h2>Rule Nr 2: strict confidentiality of your data</h2>
	<p>
		So that your credit application can be managed, much information about you is necessary. We are aware that those given information can be private and that you trust us. 
	</p>	
	<p>
		That’s why we remind you that every received and managed data is stored in a secure environment and that they won’t be sold in any case or divulge to a third party.
	</p>
	<p>
		Only the useful information to the establishment of a credit offer is transmitted to our financial partner. Who commit themselves to respect the strict confidentiality of your data and use it only in connection with the exercise of their function.
	</p>
	<h2>Rule Nr 3: Neutrality and total independence</h2>
	<p>
		CC Crédit Conseils SA is a <a href='/fr/{l file='urls' term='avantages/courtier-financier.html'}'>credit brokerage</a> company completely independent. The many partnerships we have with the various financial organizations offer us a large scheme to negotiate the best conditions for the granting of your credit or <a href='/fr/{l file='urls' term='rachat-credit.html'}'>credit repurchase</a>. None of our financial partner is dominating or privileged.
	</p>	
	<p>
		It means that you are advised totally neutrally throughout you credit application and we offer you the financing solution the most tailored to your budget and your project. It is your interests that mean to us.
