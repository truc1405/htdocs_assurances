		You want to buy a car, a motorcycle, a camper or a new boat and you hesitate between the credit and the leasing ?

	<h2>The 15th good reasons to prefer credit to leasing</h2>
	<h3>Leasing : Tempting but risky</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The vehicle is not yours.</li>
		<li>In the case of an early breach of the contract, several thousand francs may be owed.</li>
		<li>Leasing may have additional costs: exceeded mileage, options not included in the starting price. </li>
		<li>The tax deduction is not possible on the paid interest.</li>
		<li>Complete Casco Insurance is mandatory.</li>
		<li>The insurance cover is generally increased for leasing.</li>
		<li>The VAT has to be added to the interest rate shown; a private can’t get this VAT back. When VAT increases your monthly payments are also increased during the contract.</li>
		<li>No death, health, accident, unemployment cover.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Credit: no bad surprises</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The vehicle belongs to you as soon as the contract is signed.</li>
		<li>In case of problems, you can sell the vehicle as it is yours.</li>
		<li>You can subscribe to the type of insurance that suits you.</li>
		<li>Interest is deductible to the tax.</li>
		<li>The interest rate is transparent and identical throughout the contract. </li>
		<li>In case of resale of the vehicle, there is no obligation to repay directly the credit.</li>
		<li>Death, health, accident, unemployment cover! </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		So go ahead! Apply for an online credit at the best rates (from 7.5%) and get an agreement of principle in 5 minutes !
